# ===== JÖRMUNGANDR - THE WORLD SERPENT =====
# importiant boss fight but not final boss, so HP and defense are high but not final boss level. Also has more attacks than previous bosses to reflect increased difficulty, but not as many as a final boss would have. Dialogue is more extensive to reflect its importance in the story, but still leaves room for a final boss with even more depth.
